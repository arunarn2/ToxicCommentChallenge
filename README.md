# ToxicCommentChallenge
Text classification using GloVe embeddings, CNN and stacked bi-directional LSTM with Max K Pooling.  
Using dataset from Kaggle's [Jigsaw Toxic Comment Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)  

## Word Embeddings
A word embedding is an approach to provide a dense vector representation of words that capture something about their meaning. It turns text into numbers and  helps building a low-dimensional vector representation from corpus of text, which preserves the contextual similarity of words.

Word embeddings are an improvement over simpler bag-of-word model word encoding schemes like word counts and frequencies that result in large and sparse vectors (mostly 0 values) that describe documents but not the meaning of the words.

Word embeddings work by using an algorithm to train a set of fixed-length dense and continuous-valued vectors based on a large corpus of text. Each word is represented by a point in the embedding space and these points are learned and moved around based on the words that surround the target word.

It is defining a word by the company that it keeps that allows the word embedding to learn something about the meaning of words. The vector space representation of the words provides a projection where words with similar meanings are locally clustered within the space.

The use of word embeddings over other text representations is one of the key methods that has led to breakthrough performance with deep neural networks on problems like machine translation.   

For this project I used the **Stanford GloVe embeddings** downloaded from :  
**Common Crawl (840B tokens, 2.2M vocab, cased, 300d vectors, 2.03 GB download): glove.840B.300d.zip**
